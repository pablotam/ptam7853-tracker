# Song Tracker 

This is a tracker that allows you to input your favourite songs and see the patterns with them. 

# Deployment Procedures 

To install the tracker: 

<npm install> 

<npm run dev> 

# Iterations 
  
During the course of creating this song tracker, I realised some elements were going to fall through and not make it to the end product because they were either designed too poorly or not necessary for the functionality or aesthetics of the tracker. 
 
For example; 
  
  ##Outlines and Borders: 
 
In my attempt to design for responsivity I found that some elements in the mockups were causing too much clutter on the screen and it took away from the usability of the design. To solve for this I decided to remove some of the borders entirely to free up space and have easier readibility for the user. 
  
  ##Song Statistic Trackers: 
  
Initially, I implemented code that would allow for me to track top artist(s) instead of just a singular artist because I thought that it would be best practice to do so, however, when I tested this functionality out I found that if there were a list of songs with all different artists it would just read them all back which I found was counter-productive and I decided to just show the first inputted artist if there was a tie instead. 
  
#Lessons Learned 

I often found myself finding better ways to structure my code the further and deeper I got into it because I made sure to comment majority of the elements and code I created so that I could find the best practice and group elements together. From my previous works I tried to use more semantic elements in my naming coventions and use a more strcutured approach in groupings and element choices to keep it clean and within containers. 
  
  ##Media Queries 
  
This is my first time utilising Media Queries for responsivity and it was extremely helpful in simplifying the process for me as I found designing for three screens helpful in responsivity and allowed me to structure elements differently on each screen rather than having it differ drastically on each device.
  
  ##JavaScript 
  
I found the use ofjavascript very interesting and near the end of the tracker I found myself becoming more comfortable in using it to command the code to do what I wanted. I found grouping here essential and having all of the code in sections allowed me to easier navigate where problems were and console.logigng each part as a debugging method saved a lot of misfortunate and wasted time. 
 
I found the use of event listeners very helpful and could understand what was happening which I was very proud of, and I found that in some code iterations I was able to combine different functions to simplify and make my code the most efficient rather than having multiple interrupting code. 
 
#Recommendations 
  
##Future Installments 
 
  For future installments of this song tracker I would like to get the photo's to work as I put in a placeholder.svg file which worked for the form but I couldn't get the img element to work in displaying the image as it would always appear as a thumbnail. 
  
  I would also like to implement a transition between each "page" section of the tracker as I wanted the 'create-taste' part to slide up from the button but the sass I used wasn't working and I couldn't debug in time. I tried using keyframes and anime functions but I found that it would break the code more than providing anything of worth to the tracker so I decided to remove it.
